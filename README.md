# 🚗 Vehicle Emission Analysis using Simple Linear Regression

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project was developed as part of my self-learning journey in machine learning. The primary goal is to explore the impact of various vehicle parameters on their CO₂ emission levels using **Simple Linear Regression**.

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It contains technical specifications of different vehicles such as engine size, fuel consumption, number of cylinders, and their corresponding CO₂ emissions.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**

> 📦 All required packages and libraries for running this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The project focuses on applying **Simple Linear Regression** to examine how a single independent variable (e.g., engine size or fuel consumption) affects CO₂ emissions. The process includes:

* Data loading and inspection
* Data visualization
* Feature selection
* Model training
* Performance evaluation

## 📈 Key Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding the dataset
* Visual correlation between variables
* Implementation of simple linear regression using `sklearn`
* Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open and run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

## 🔍 Use Case

Understanding which vehicle characteristics most significantly affect emissions can be helpful in both:

* **Environmental research**: Supporting sustainable vehicle design
* **Policy making**: Informing regulations for greener transportation

## 📌 Project Status

This project is part of my hands-on learning in machine learning and is open for further improvements (e.g., adding multiple regression, feature scaling, or cross-validation).
